Subject: Contract Review - Service Agreement Q1 2024
Date: Today, 9:15 AM

Hi [Your Name],

Thank you for sending the service agreement. I've reviewed the document and have a few questions:

1. Can we adjust the payment terms from NET 30 to NET 45?
2. The liability cap seems low at $50K - can we increase to $200K?
3. We'd like to add a force majeure clause

Please let me know if these changes are acceptable. We're hoping to finalize this by end of week.

Best regards,
John Smith
VP of Operations, TechCorp

## 📋 Use Case 2: Invoice Processing & Dispute Resolution

### Scenario: Handling Invoice Dispute Email

**Problem Email Received:**
```
From: accounts.payable@megacorp.com  
Subject: URGENT: Invoice Discrepancy - INV-2024-0156
Date: Today, 8:42 AM

Hi,

We received invoice INV-2024-0156 dated March 15th for $12,850. However, our purchase order PO-45781 was for $11,200. 

There's a $1,650 discrepancy that needs immediate clarification. We need:

1. Detailed breakdown of charges
2. Explanation of additional costs  
3. Supporting documentation

This is blocking payment processing. Please resolve ASAP.

Best,
Susan Chen
Accounts Payable Manager
MegaCorp Industries
```

    {
      "id": "doc_789",
      "filename": "INV-2024-0156_MegaCorp.pdf",
      "type": "invoice",
      "amount": "$12,850",
      "status": "sent"
    },

    }
  ]
}

#### Step 2: Automated Discrepancy Analysis
```
🔍 Data Extraction Agent Analysis:

📊 Invoice Breakdown:
• Original PO Amount: $11,200
• Additional Work Order: $1,650

Hi Susan,

Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I've investigated the discrepancy and found the resolution.

**Summary:**
The $1,650 difference represents authorized additional work that was approved on March 18th via Work Order Change #WOC-2024-033. This may not have been communicated to your accounts payable team.

**Detailed Breakdown:**
• Original PO-45781: $11,200 ✅
• Additional Work (WOC-2024-033): $1,650 ✅  
• Total Invoice Amount: $12,850 ✅

**Documentation Attached:**
1. Complete invoice package with all supporting documents
2. Detailed cost breakdown summary
3. Work order change authorization (signed by Tom Wilson, Project Manager)

The additional work involved emergency server maintenance on March 16-17, which was pre-approved by your project team due to the critical nature of the issue.

This should resolve the payment processing block. Please let me know if you need any additional documentation.

Best regards,
