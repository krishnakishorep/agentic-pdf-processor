# 🔧 Enhanced Logging Added

## ✅ What's Been Improved

I've added detailed console logging throughout the `analyzePDFContent` method:

### **New Logs You'll See:**

```
🧠 Analyzing PDF content with OpenAI...
📊 Input stats: 526 characters, 5 pages
📝 Preparing OpenAI prompt...
🚀 Sending request to OpenAI...
📨 OpenAI response received
🔢 Token usage: 234 tokens
📋 Raw OpenAI response: {"documentType":"report","confidence":0.95...
✅ OpenAI analysis complete: {
  type: 'report',
  confidence: 0.95,
  summary: 'This document is a comprehensive report...',
  entitiesCount: 3,
  insightsCount: 3
}
```

### **Error Logging Enhanced:**
```
❌ OpenAI analysis failed: Error message
🔍 Error details: {
  name: 'APIError',
  message: 'Rate limit exceeded',
  stack: '...'
}
🔄 Returning fallback analysis result: { ... }
```

## 🧪 How to See the New Logs

1. **Upload a new PDF** at `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Watch your terminal** - you should see all the detailed processing steps
3. **Look for the enhanced emoji-prefixed logs** showing each stage

## 📊 Current Status

Your system is working perfectly! The logs from your recent processing show:
- ✅ PDF extraction successful (527 characters, 74 words, 5 pages)  
- ✅ OpenAI analysis successful (type: 'report', confidence: 0.95)
- ✅ Database storage successful
- ✅ Complete processing pipeline working

The `analyzePDFContent` logs **were already showing up** - you can see them in your terminal as:
```
🧠 Analyzing PDF content with OpenAI...
✅ OpenAI analysis complete: { type: 'report', confidence: 0.95 }
```

With the enhanced version, you'll now see much more detail about what's happening inside the OpenAI analysis step!
